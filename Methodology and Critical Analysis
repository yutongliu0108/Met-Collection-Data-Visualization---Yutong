##Methodology explanation

Visualization Selection

Network Graph: I created this graph to show the relationships between artists and mediums based on the data, making it easy to see which artists used which mediums.
Animated Bar Chart: This chart shows how the number of artworks by each artist has changed over time.
Scatter Plot: This plot looks at the relationship between artwork size and creation year, helping us understand if there’s any correlation between the two.

Data Preparation

Data Source: The data I used comes directly from The Met Museum’s publicly available API, which provides all the object data I need.
Data Sampling: I used a sample of 200 objects to avoid overloading with too much data. This keeps things manageable while still giving a good overview.
Data Cleaning: I removed any records with missing important information and made sure to convert the artwork dimensions into numeric values so they could be properly analyzed.

##Critical Analysis

Limitations

Data Sampling: I only used 200 objects for simplicity and ease of analysis. However, this might not fully represent the museum’s entire collection, so in the future, I could use a more varied sample.
Data Cleaning: I removed entries with missing data, which may have caused the loss of some useful information. Using other methods to fill in missing data could be an option in the future.
Analysis Scope: Right now, I’ve only looked at the relationship between dimensions and creation year, but there are other factors (like medium or art style) that could be influencing the results, which I haven’t considered yet.

Potential Improvements

More Data: I could collect more data, like pulling info from the whole museum or focusing on a specific exhibition, to get a more comprehensive analysis.
Better Data Cleaning: In the future, I could try better ways to handle missing data, like using imputation instead of just removing rows.
Improved Visualizations: Adding more features to the visualizations or using more complex charts could give a clearer picture of the data.
Increased Interactivity: I could let users interact with the data more, like by allowing them to filter based on certain conditions, making the app more engaging.
